            Don’t you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean
            user interface? While most of us would reply with an assertive

            into making a website attractive and user-friendly. The secret to

            development, and no, it is not as easy as it seems!
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips that’ll
            help you get better in front-end design and web development.

                1 = through that Css class:
                2 = we only have to put that class on the content that we want to uppercase on the html or on the webpage
                3 = for using that Css class on the html we have to use the(class) attribute of the html: and we have to give the name of Css class to the html class -->

              <h4 class="case styleText">Commenting</h4>
              <p>
                Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by
                programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple
                programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of
                project you create. With proper comments and organised files its
                always easier for you or others to jump in and understand where
                things are at and how they work.

                Refactor Your Code From Time To Time.
              </h4>
              <p>
                By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code
                without tampering with its functionality. This will improve the
                quality and readability quotient of your code and the more often
                you do it, your code will continually be updated into a cleaner
                and fresher version of what it was before. Apart from that, one
                of the most significant advantages that refactoring offers is
                that it ensures your code remains free from plagiarism.

              <h4 class="case styleText">Version Control</h4>
              <p>
                As a developer, version control is something that you must know
                about. Version control systems let you keep track of changes
                made to the code over time. And not just this, they also make it
                easy to revert back to an earlier version if you screw something
                up. Thus using verion control will save you some sleepless
                nights for sure. One of the most widely used version control
                systems is Git. Thus knowing git has been a requirement for
                almost every development job these days.

            While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end
            designer, in the long run, you must always remember two things while
            designing your platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t forget
            to create your signature style.
