                The div tag is known as Division tag. The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content in the
                web
                page like (text, images, header, footer, navigation bar, etc).
                <!-- Div tag has both (<div>) and closing (</div>) -->
                tag and it is mandatory to close the tag. The Div is the most usable tag in web
                development because it helps us to separate out data in the web page and we can create a particular
                section
                for
                particular data or function in the web pages.

                </li>
                <li>
                    It is used to the group of various tags of HTML so that sections can be created and style can be
                    applied to
                    them.
