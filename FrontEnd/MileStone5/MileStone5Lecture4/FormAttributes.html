  <body>
    <!-- under the (form) tag we have many kind of attributes:
    1 = (action) attribute is used for connecting our form with the server:
    we simple put the server's (url) in the Action attribute
    2 = (method) attribute is used to define the sever's (url) method:
    like (http) etc: (http) is basically a request method :
    3 = we are basically using the two http request those are mainlly used for the froms (get) and (post) 
    a = (get) used for when we want some information from the server
    b = (post) used for when we want store some data in the server. or want to update some already exited data -->
    <!-- other difference between the (get) and (post):
    1 = (get) will simply collect your request and paste it on the server's url
    in this way its getting risky to use get: because in this way it will delcare our information to the other persons
    2 = (Post) will not do the same thing as  (get) attribute because it will not change your url it will simply send data to the server -->
    <form action="" method="post">
      <p>Months</p>
      <!-- for creating a drop-down list we are using a (select)tag -->
      <!-- if we want to select the multiple options for that we can use the (multiple) attributes:
            1 = use (ctrl) for selecting multiple values on the browser-->
      <select name="month-selection" multiple>
        <!-- under the selection tag we are using the (option)tag for creating a options for the drop-down list -->
        <option>jan</option>
        <!-- if we want that one of the option should we selected by default: for that we can use the(selected) attribute -->
        <option selected>feb</option>
        <option>mar</option>

      </select>

      <!-- if we want to get the  multiple lines input from the user : for that we can use the (textarea)tag
                1 = like we want to get the (experience) of the user related to our webpage -->
      <!-- we can also define the structure of this textarea acc to our prefrences
                1 = we can define its (rows)
                2 = we can define its (columns) -->
