// here we learn about (==) or (===):
// here In javascript (==) will gave us a unexpected values.that's why engineers introduced the (===) function.for removing  that unexpected values error in the javascript.
// IMP = this error mostly comes In when we are checking the two types of datatype values:

// if we use (==) function for checking the two values:then that will gave us a wrong output:
console.log(1 == '1');

//but if instead of (==) function we use (===) then this will provide us a correct output:
console.log(1 === '1');
// or we use (!=) then it will also gave us  a wrong ouptut:but if use (!==) then this will gave us a correct output:

console.log(1 != '1');

console.log(1 !== '1');
