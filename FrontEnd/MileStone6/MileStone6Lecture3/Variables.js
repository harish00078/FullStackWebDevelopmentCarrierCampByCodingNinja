// 1 = here we learn about. that how we can declare (variables) in the javaScript.
// here in javascript we use (var) for creating varaibles.
var a = 10;
// 2 = here in javascript (variable) does not depend on the the variables data-type.It working with its (value).means if we create variable (a).then this variable can  work with any data-type value .because in javascript variables work with there values only.
a = "hello";
// for printing  our coding in the javascript we use (console.log()) statement.under its brackets we define the variable that we want to print.
console.log(a);
