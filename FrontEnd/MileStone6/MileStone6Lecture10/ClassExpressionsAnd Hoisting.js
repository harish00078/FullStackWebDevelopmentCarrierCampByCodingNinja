// (hoisted) means the function:which we can be accessable in anywhere of the (file):were that function has been created:

// here we are creating the function: or we can say (constructor) funtion:with the help of (class) keyword:

// first we define the class:

class vehicle {

  // second:we define the constructor function:
  // here we did not have to gave the name to the (constructor) function:
  // because this constructor function will be called with the help of the (class) name:

  constructor(numWheels, price) {
    this.numWheels = numWheels;
    this.price = price;
  }

  // we can also create multiple functions under the one (class):
  // so here we create a function for getting price of the vehicles:

  // here we simply create function:
  getPrice(){
    // and this will return us the price of the vehicle:
    return this.price;
  }


}
