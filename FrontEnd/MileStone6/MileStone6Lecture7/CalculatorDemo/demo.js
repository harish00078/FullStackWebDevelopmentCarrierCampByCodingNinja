// under javascript we have function. that we use to get the (evaluation) of the values. acc to the operator that we gave to him:
// name of the function is (eval()):

// for example if we (multiples) the two values:we do that in two way's aslo:

// 1 = first is that we can simple use the (eval) function with in the (console.log()) function:like this:
console.log(eval('4 * 5'));

// 2 = second is that we can create a two variables were we get the two values.and we create another one more variable were we provide the operator:
var op1 = 4;
var op2 = 5;
var operator = '*';

// and after that we create a another variables.were we use the eval function with these two variable values and also use the operator variable:Like this:
var result = eval(op1 + " " + operator + " " +op2);
// then we use the only last (result) variables in the print statement:
console.log(result);
