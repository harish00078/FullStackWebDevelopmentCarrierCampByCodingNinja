<body>
  <!-- here we are using the function for the handler that we have created in the java-script file:
  => but the onlything is that through (event_attribute) we are only able to gave the one-handler function to the event: -->
  <button id="btn1" onclick="sayHello()"> BUTTON-1</button>
  
  <button id="btn2"> BUTTON-2</button>
<!-- 
  // for connecting the java-script file with the html-file:we  have to use the (script-tag):
  // And  under that script-tag we have to provide the source of the (java-script)file:In this way we can connect the html-file with the External java-script file:

  // IMP = we have to two ways to  provide the source of the java-script file to the script-tag:
  // 1 = if we have the java-script file in the same folder were we also have the webpage html-file:then we can provide the (relative)file path to the source of the script-tag:means the name of the java-script file with its extension:like this (Script.js):

  // 2 = but if we have the java-script file in the another folder.then we can provide the (absolute) file path to the source of the script-tag:means we have to provide the full folder-path with its extension:like this(app/documents/java-script/Script.js): -->

  <script src="Script.js"></script>
