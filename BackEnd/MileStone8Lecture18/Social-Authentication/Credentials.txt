// lean about:what are the (Credentials):

Credentials are a set of information used to authenticate a user or a client application to access a system or resource. Credentials typically consist of two components: a username (or identifier) and a password (or secret).

In the context of user authentication, credentials are used to verify the identity of the user and grant access to a system or service. The user enters their username and password, which are then verified by the system or service to determine whether the user is authorized to access the requested resource. In some cases, additional security measures such as two-factor authentication may be required to provide additional protection against unauthorized access.

// what is the meaning of (Credentials) with (OAuth2.0) framework:
In the context of client application authentication, credentials are used to verify the identity of the client application and grant it access to resources or data. For example, in OAuth 2.0 authentication flows, a client application may be required to provide a client ID and a client secret as credentials to the authorization server in order to obtain an access token to access a user's resources.

Credentials are a critical component of security systems, and they need to be carefully protected to prevent unauthorized access. Best practices for credential security include storing passwords in encrypted form, using strong and unique passwords, and limiting access to credentials to only authorized individuals or systems.
