In Node.js, a helper function is a function that is designed to assist in the execution of other functions or to perform a specific task. Helper functions are used to improve code readability and maintainability by breaking down complex operations into smaller, more manageable pieces of code.

Helper functions can be defined in the same file as the function that calls them or can be defined in a separate file and imported into the calling function using the "require" statement.

Some common examples of helper functions in Node.js include:

=> Validation functions - Functions that validate user input or ensure that data conforms to a specific format or standard.

=> Utility functions - Functions that provide common utility operations, such as formatting data or handling errors.

=> Middleware functions - Functions that process incoming HTTP requests before they are passed to the main request handler function.

Overall, helper functions can greatly simplify and improve the structure of Node.js code, making it easier to read, maintain, and debug.
