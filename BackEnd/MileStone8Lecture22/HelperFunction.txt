JsRender templates are made up of HTML markup, text, and template tags. Template tags are used to evaluate data-paths or computed expressions, and insert those values into the rendered output.

But often the values you will want to insert are not actually taken from the data, but rather from other parameters or metadata which you want to use. And often you will want to process the values, using helper functions or other code, e.g. for converting values to other formats, or for computed values.

Helpers, in JsRender, refers to any functions, objects, parameters or metadata which you want to provide, in addition to the actual data you passed to the render() method (or link() method if you are using JsViews).

Helpers can also be objects, arrays, etc.
