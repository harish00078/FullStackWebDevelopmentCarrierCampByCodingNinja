// here we are creating the home-component for our application:

// we are creating the home page or component through  (Function) component type:
// so for creating the (home) page we can use the (arrow) function:instead of using casual function:
// and we can also use the (Const) variable-type on that arrow function:

const Home = () => {
  // under this arrow function.we will write the (html) for our (home-page):
  // and return it from this function.
  // so that we can export it from this file: and use it in our (application):

  return(
    <div ></div>
  );


};

// here we are exporting the (home-page) component:
export default Home;
