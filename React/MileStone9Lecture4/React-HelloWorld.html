  <!-- here we are creating  the (function) based react components: -->
  <!-- for creating (react) components:we have to use the (script-tag):because we are only able to create the (functions) under the (script-tag): -->

  <!-- and that (script-tag's) type should be in the form of  (text/babel):
  => because with the help of (text/babel) type: know we you can use JSX in any <script> tag by adding type="text/babel" attribute to it.  -->





  <!-- way of creating (React-Component): -->

  <script type="text/babel">


    //  here under the  script-tag:we are  creating the (react) components:with the help of the  (function):

    // IMP => every component that we create in the (react):is basically repersented by  a (object):

    function App() {

      // here we are simply returing the (hello-world) in this component:

      //  here the (heading-tag) that we are using:
      // => they are not in the form of  (html) syntax:
      // => they are basically in the form of (JSX) syntax:

      // IMP = here we are using the (jsx) syntax format:for creating the (react)components:so our browser does not understand the (jsx) syntax:that why we are using the (babel) in  the  (type) of the (script-tag):
      // 1 => (babel) basically work as a (compiler) between (jsx) and (browser):
      // 2 => (babel) basically convert this (jsx) in the (form) of the  (normal-javascript):which is understandble by the (browser):

      return <h1> Hello World</h1>

    }

    // react components are not directly get (render) to the (browser):for (rendering) them we have to use the (ReactDOM.render) function: 

    // IMP =  (object) that is given the (react) component:we did not directly use that in the (browser):so that's  why  we are using the (ReactDOM.render) function:
    // => which will convert these (react) component (object) into the (DOM-nodes) or (nodes):

    // => after that it will push those (DOM-nodes) basically in the (DOM):because browser will only understand the (DOM) elements:

    // IMP =>we are pushing them into the (DOM):with help of (referencing) them or putting them in the (simple-html) format:In  this way we will connnect those (DOM_nodes) with the browser (DOM):
    // =>  like here we are connecting the (render) function:with the (div-tag):that is basically a simple-html element:

    ReactDOM.render(


      // under the render function:we have to define the two things:
      // => first we have to provide the (component):that we want to render:that component should be in the (tag-syntax):and also it has the (backslash) in the end of the (tag) syntax:


      <App />,

      // =>second we have to tell that:were we want to render this (component):
      // => so we want to render this component:In the (div-tag) that we have created in the (body-tag):out of this script-tag: 
      // => so for connecting this render function:with the (div-tag):we have to use the (id) of the (div-tag):so we can gave the (div-tag) reference to the (render) function:


      document.getElementById('app')

    );
