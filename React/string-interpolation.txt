(String-Interpolation):
=> String interpolation is a great programming language feature that allows injecting variables, function calls, arithmetic expressions directly into a string. String interpolation was absent in JavaScript before ES6. String interpolation is a new feature of ES6, that can make multi-line strings without the need for an escape character. We can use apostrophes and quotes easily that they can make our strings and therefore our code easier to read as well. These are some of the reasons to use string interpolation over string concatenation.
(example):

=>  String Interpolation
function myInfo(fname, lname, country) {
    return `My name is ${fname} ${lname}. ${country} is my favorite country`; 
}
console.log(myInfo("john", "doe", "India"));


output: My name is john doe. India is my favorite country
